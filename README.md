# Password_Machine

## Description

This project was made to create a password between 8 and 128 characters with features that depended on what the user wanted in their password. The user has selection of lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and special characters. While in the end this was a fairly short program the areas I struggled the most where in learning about while loops and making an array only spit out a specific number of characters.

## Installation 

This program is ready to run now. There is no installation necessary.

## Usage

To run this program you simply press the generate password button. After you press the button you are prompted to answer 5 questions about your desired characteristics. When you are finished with the prompt, you will see a password generated for you on the screen. 

## Credits

I absolutely could not have completed this project without the help of my tutor Kat or my study group. Without them I would never have found my bugs.
